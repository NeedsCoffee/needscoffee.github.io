Here is where to get hold of version 5 of Orca - the one most suitable for Windows 7 able to validate .msi files for Windows Installer 5. It is in the [Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=6b6c21d2-2006-4afa-9702-529fa782d63b). Unfortunately there's no mini-download for the msi sdk like with version 4.5.

You need to install the debugging tools from the Windows SDK, then go in to `C:\Program Files\Windows SDK\7.1\Bin` and orca.msi will be in there.

\[Update 2012-09-08: there's a slightly **newer version available** [here](/2012/09/orca-5-for-windows-8/)\]
