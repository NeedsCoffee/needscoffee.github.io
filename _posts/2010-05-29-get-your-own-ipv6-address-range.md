[![IPv6 Certification Badge for njfclark](/images/ipv6_badge.png)](https://ipv6.he.net/certification/scoresheet.php?pass_name=njfclark)

I decided to learn about IPv6 and signed up to get my own IPv6 address range. It's all free and you learn loads in the process.

Just visit <https://www.tunnelbroker.net> sign-up and get learning about IPv6!

They provide a free PPTP VPN tunnel service so you can set your laptop to have its own static IPv6 address no matter where you're connecting to the internet from. Plus you get free DNS management and rDNS too!!!

I have to say, it's pretty cool to be able to give my laptop a static forward and reverse AAAA record.

A follow-up post on how to use your new IPv6 range on a D-Link DIR-825 cable-router to give your whole network IPv6 automatically is [here](/2010/10/use-a-d-link-dir-825-to-automatically-ipv6-your-network/)
